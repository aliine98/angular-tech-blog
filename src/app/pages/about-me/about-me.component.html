        <p class="md:text-center w-3/4">I am a dedicated and determined professional who enjoys learning a lot and always aims to deliver the best. I started studying programming through the PotÃªncia Tech site powered by iFood, and later had the opportunity to participate in the Oracle Next Education program, a partnership between Alura and Oracle. Since then, I have fallen in love with programming because it stimulates my creativity, and I love how I can solve one thing in various different ways! I continue to study regularly and stay tuned for opportunities for free courses and bootcamps.</p>
